# Numerical Optimization Project

This repository contains the implementation of the Modified Newton method for solving Large Scale Optimization Problems. The method is applied to the Rosenbrock function in 𝑅² and three additional optimization problems. The code is accompanied by Steepest Descent with backtracking strategies.
